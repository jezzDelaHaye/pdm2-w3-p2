    <h1>2 Star Exercise</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>sketch.js and player.js contain code for a partially implemented game. You will 
                add code to manage the game state. Run the code then take a look through both 
                JavaScript files to see what has been implemented so far.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Look at the <code>draw()</code> function in sketch.js. Currently the <code>drawStart()</code> function 
                is called. Comment out this function and try uncommenting each of the other function calls in 
            turn. <code>thePlayer.draw()</code> and <code>thePlayer.move()</code> should be uncommented at the same time. You 
        should see that each function draws a different message on the canvas, and that the player methods show a red 
    square that can be moved with the left and right arrow keys.</li>
                <li>Add a <code>switch</code> statement to the <code>draw()</code> function 
                that determines whether to call <code>drawStart()</code>, <code>drawWin()</code>, <code>drawDied()</code>, or 
            the player methods depending on whether state is equal to <code>START</code>, <code>PLAYING</code>, <code>WIN</code>, or <code>DIED</code>.</li>
                <li>Test your code by changing the value of <code>state</code> and seeing what happens.</li>
                <li>Add code to the <code>keyPressed()</code> function so that if <code>state</code> is <code>START</code> and 
                the Enter key is pressed, then <code>state</code> becomes <code>PLAYING</code>.</li>
                <li>The <code>Player</code> class should have its own state with three possible values: alive, died, or win. You may choose how 
                to implement the <code>Player</code> state. Also modify the <code>Player.move()</code> method so that it updates 
            state as needed—when the player goes over the left side of the screen, it dies. If it goes off the right edge of the 
            canvas, it escapes.</li>
                <li>Update sketch.js to set the overall game state to <code>WIN</code> or <code>DIED</code> as appropriate if the player's state 
                changes. You may need to add an additional method or two to the <code>Player</code> class as well.</li>
                <li>Finally, add code to the <code>keyPressed()</code> function so that if the user presses Enter when 
                the game state is either <code>WIN</code> or <code>DIED</code>, the game restarts.</li>
            </ol>

                    <p>To implement steps 4 and 7, it may be helpful to know that you can have multiple lines of code inside a case block. You can even nest <code>if</code> statements or <code>switch</code> statements inside a case.</p>
                    <p>To implement <code>Player</code> state, it is suggested that you use private string instance variables to 
                        store the possible states (e.g. "escaped") and another private variable to store the current player state. You will need to update 
                    the <code>Player</code> state in the <code>move()</code> method if it goes out of bounds. You will also need to decide how the main sketch should 
                access the <code>Player</code> state to determine how the game state should be updated.</p>
